    <h3>Cooking Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). 
                Grease 6 cups of a muffin tin.
            </li>
            <li>
                Stir sugar, salt, cumin, and garlic powder into the melted butter in a bowl. 
                Add flour slowly, mixing until moist but not sticky; 
                should be able to manipulate it with your hands.
            </li>
            <li>
                Separate tart dough into 6 sections;
                roll each into a ball and flatten into a round in your hand.
                Press into the prepared muffin cups. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Bake in the preheated oven until lightly browned, about 10 minutes.  
            </li>
            <li>
                While crusts are baking, heat oil over medium-high heat in a skillet. 
                Saute onion and white sections of green onions in the hot oil until 
                just starting to brown, 5 to 7 minutes. Add chicken, soy-based liquid 
                seasoning, salt, and pepper; saute for 1 to 2 minutes. Add butter 
                chicken sauce and cook until warmed through, 1 to 2 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Spoon butter chicken mixture into the baked tart shells. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Bake in the preheated oven until lightly browned, about 5 minutes. 
                Remove tarts from tin using a butter knife and tongs. 
                Sprinkle green sections of green onions on top.
            </li>
