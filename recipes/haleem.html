    <h3>Cooking Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Combine beef, water, 
                cracked wheat, yogurt, 
                cooked rice, yellow lentils, 
                white lentils, ginger-garlic paste, 
                and haleem masala in a pot. 
                Bring to a boil over medium heat, 
                while stirring often.
            </li>
            <li>
                Reduce heat and simmer for 8 to 12 hours. 
                After 4 to 6 hours of cook time, check water level and 
                add 1 to 2 cups of water as needed so haleem does not get too thick. 
                Taste and season with salt to taste. 
                The haleem should have porridge consistency. 
            </li>
        </ol>
